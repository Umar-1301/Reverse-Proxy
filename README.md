# Reverse-Proxy

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project simulates an enterprise-grade network with a secure reverse proxy setup, showcasing advanced networking and security principles in a virtual lab environment.

The main goal was to securely expose an internal web server to external users through a layered security architecture using NAT, firewalls, DNS, and routing.

âœ… **End Result**: A successful HTTP connection from a remote user to an internal web server using the public domain `shoosmiths.com`, routed through a Cloudflare-style proxy firewall.

## âœ… Technologies and Skills Demonstrated

- Static and dynamic routing  
- PAT (Port Address Translation)  
- Static NAT, Object NAT, and Twice NAT  
- DNS server integration for public name resolution  
- ASA firewall configuration  
- Return path routing for end-to-end packet delivery  
- Web server configuration  
- Basic HTML serving  
- Network segmentation: DMZ, Public, Private zones

## ðŸš€ Network Flow Summary

1. A user types `shoosmiths.com` into their browser.
2. The DNS query is sent to a public DNS server (8.8.8.8), which resolves the domain to `170.40.20.2`.
3. The Edge Router receives the request and performs PAT, translating the destination to `172.16.10.1`.
4. Traffic is forwarded to the ASA Firewall, which is listening on `172.16.10.2`.
5. The ASA performs Static NAT, forwarding the request to the internal web server at `192.168.1.2`.
6. The web server serves the HTML page:  
   `Hello, welcome to Shoosmiths`.
7. The return traffic follows the reverse NAT and routing path, successfully reaching the user.
